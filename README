NAME
    Math::Random::ISAAC - Perl interface to the ISAAC PRNG Algorithm

$Id$

DESCRIPTION
    As with other Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) algorithms like the
    Mersenne Twister (see Math::Random::MT), this algorithm is designed to
    take some seed information and produce seemingly random results as
    output.

    However, ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count) has
    different goals than these commonly used algorithms. In particular, it's
    really fast - on average, it requires only 18.75 machine cycles to
    generate a 32-bit value. This makes it suitable for applications where a
    significant amount of random data needs to be produced quickly, such
    solving using the Monte Carlo method or for games.

    The results are uniformly distributed, unbiased, and unpredictable
    unless you know the seed. The algorithm was published by Bob Jenkins in
    the late 90s and despite the best efforts of many security researchers,
    no feasible attacks have been found to date.

COMPATIBILITY
    This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. However,
    because it's Pure Perl and doesn't do anything too obscure, it should be
    compatible with any version of Perl that supports its prerequisite
    modules.

    If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture,
    please contact the maintainer.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    *   Special thanks to Bob Jenkins <bob_jenkins@burtleburtle.net> for
        devising this very clever algorithm and releasing it into the public
        domain.

    *   Thanks to John L. Allen (contact unknown) for providing a Perl port
        of the original ISAAC code, upon which "Math::Random::ISAAC::PP" is
        heavily based. His version is available on Bob's web site, in the
        SEE ALSO section.
