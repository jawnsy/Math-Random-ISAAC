NAME
    Math::Random::ISAAC - Perl interface to the ISAAC PRNG Algorithm

$Id$

DESCRIPTION
    As with other Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) algorithms like the
    Mersenne Twister (see Math::Random::MT), this algorithm is designed to
    take some seed information and produce seemingly random results as
    output.

    However, ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count) has
    different goals than these commonly used algorithms. In particular, it's
    really fast - on average, it requires only 18.75 machine cycles to
    generate a 32-bit value. This makes it suitable for applications where a
    significant amount of random data needs to be produced quickly, such
    solving using the Monte Carlo method or for games.

    The results are uniformly distributed, unbiased, and unpredictable
    unless you know the seed. The algorithm was published by Bob Jenkins in
    the late 90s and despite the best efforts of many security researchers,
    no feasible attacks have been found to date.

SYNOPSIS
      use Math::Random::ISAAC;

      my $rng = Math::Random::ISAAC->new(@seeds);

      for (0..30) {
        print 'Result: ' . $rng->irand() . "\n";
      }

PURPOSE
    The intent of this module is to provide single simple interface to the
    two compatible implementations of this module, namely,
    Math::Random::ISAAC::XS and Math::Random::ISAAC::PP.

    If, for some reason, you need to determine what version of the module is
    actually being included by "Math::Random::ISAAC", then:

      print 'Backend type: ', $Math::Random::ISAAC::DRIVER, "\n";

    In order to force use of one or the other, simply load the appropriate
    module:

      use Math::Random::ISAAC::XS;
      my $rng = Math::Random::ISAAC::XS->new();
      # or
      use Math::Random::ISAAC::PP;
      my $rng = Math::Random::ISAAC::PP->new();

COMPATIBILITY
    This module was tested under Perl 5.10.0, using Debian Linux. However,
    because it's Pure Perl and doesn't do anything too obscure, it should be
    compatible with any version of Perl that supports its prerequisite
    modules.

    If you encounter any problems on a different version or architecture,
    please contact the maintainer.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    *   Special thanks to Bob Jenkins <bob_jenkins@burtleburtle.net> for
        devising this very clever algorithm and releasing it into the public
        domain.

    *   Thanks to John L. Allen (contact unknown) for providing a Perl port
        of the original ISAAC code, upon which "Math::Random::ISAAC::PP" is
        heavily based. His version is available on Bob's web site, in the
        SEE ALSO section.

CAVEATS
  KNOWN BUGS
    There are no known bugs as of this release.

  LIMITATIONS
    *   There is no method that allows re-seeding of algorithms. This is not
        really necessary because one can simply call "new" again with the
        new seed data periodically.

    *   There was no method supplied to provide the initial seed data. On
        his web site, Bob Jenkins writes:

          Seeding a random number generator is essentially the same problem as
          encrypting the seed with a block cipher.

        But he also provides a simple workaround:

          As ISAAC is intended to be a secure cipher, if you want to reseed
          it, one way is to use some other cipher to seed some initial version
          of ISAAC, then use ISAAC's output as a seed for other instances of
          ISAAC whenever they need to be reseeded.

    *   There is no way to clone a PRNG instance. I'm not sure why this is
        might even be necessary or useful. File a bug report with an
        explanation why and I'll consider adding it to the next release.
